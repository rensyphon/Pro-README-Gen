# Pro-README-Gen

## Description

This project refactors code to create a command line README generator, created using Node.js and the Inquirer package.

## Installation

## Usage

A video explaining how to start and use the program may be viewed here: .

Once the program is running, the user will be prompted to answer a series of questions. After inputing the answer to each one and pressing enter, the program will generate a pre-filled README file to the `/dist` folder as `readme.md`. A generated README has been included in the repo as an example.
